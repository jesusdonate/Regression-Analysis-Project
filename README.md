# STAT 510 Regression Analysis Project
This project was created for my STAT 510: Regression Analysis class in CSU Long Beach. The 
purpose of this report was to create 

### Quick Abstract of Report:
This report analyzes the effect of Florida’s 1980 intrastate trucking deregulation on shipping 
prices using shipment data from before and after deregulation. Two regression models were created to 
address the impact of deregulation on prices. The results provide strong evidence that deregulation significantly lowered 
trucking prices in Florida and offer an accurate regression model for predicting future shipping costs in a 
post-regulatory environment. 

### Linear Regression Final Statistical Report.pdf:
This is the document detailing my insights to the dataset TRUCKING.txt.

### TRUCKING.txt:
There are 10 variables within the dataset. Section 1 (Data Description/Preparation) of Methods 
in the report describes each variable and how the dataset was prepared for analysis.

### stat510_final_project_code.sas:
